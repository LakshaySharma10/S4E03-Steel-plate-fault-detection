# S4E03-Steel-plate-fault-detection
<p>In this competition, the objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting defaults in steel plates. My approach involved employing XGBoostingCV to achieve the highest possible Roc-auc score. Additionally, I performed extensive feature engineering and parameter tuning using Optuna to optimize the model's performance.
